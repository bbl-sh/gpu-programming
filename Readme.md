# CUDA and OpenCL Learning Repository

## 🚀 Motivation

Inspired by the incredible performance optimizations demonstrated by DeepSeek, I decided to explore GPU computing technologies like CUDA and OpenCL. The goal is to understand, experiment with, and optimize code execution on GPUs for various computational tasks.

## 📌 What You'll Find Here

- Sample CUDA implementations
- Basic OpenCL scripts
- Optimization techniques for GPU computation
- Performance benchmarks and insights

## 💡 Why CUDA and OpenCL?

- **CUDA:** Powerful parallel computing platform developed by NVIDIA, ideal for high-performance tasks.
- **OpenCL:** An open standard framework for writing programs across heterogeneous platforms including CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators.

## 🛠 Getting Started

1. Open Kaggle/google Colab for free gpu testing of  codes

2. Install cuda if not installed and then type this command to run the shell in jupyter notebook itself
```bash
pip install nvcc4jupyter
%load_ext nvcc4jupyter
```
3. Get the info of the gpu
```bash
!nvidia-smi
!nvcc --version
```

## 📈 Optimization Goals

- Learn parallel programming paradigms
- Improve computational efficiency
- Explore memory management and kernel optimizations
